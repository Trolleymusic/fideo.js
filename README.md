### Makes your damn video embeds fit proper

I've been sticking loads of youtube and vimeo embeds in sites recently, and they're easy to do, but there's always a few extra lines of CSS and a couple of extra div wrappers you need to write to get them to be dynamically sized and/or work properly in a responsive design without them hanging out the end.

So fideo is a little piece of javascript that you run on the embedded iframe and it'll take care of everything.
